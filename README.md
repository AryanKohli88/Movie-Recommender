https://recommend-me-a-movie.streamlit.app/

# Potential Improvements for future:
1. More movies' information can be added to data set => Allow users to decribe a movie of their choice
2. Give unequal weightage to keywords from different columns. Example: Though keywords in movie description and crew both are important, if we ask a user based on what he wants recomendations, we can give more weightage to words from either columns.

# To Run
streamlit run app.py

# Note
Due to large size of similarity.pkl, git lfs is used to push it.
